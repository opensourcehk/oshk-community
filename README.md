# oshk-community
Open Source HK Community is a public Git repo to organise what we are doing for the community. We are looking for volunteers who can contribute to the community.

## What are we doing?

You can check the open issues in the [Issues](https://github.com/opensourcehk/oshk-community/issues) of this repo to find out what are we doing.
